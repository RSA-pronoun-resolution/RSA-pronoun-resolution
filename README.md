# A Rational Speech Act model of cross-linguistic pronoun resolution

## About

This repository contains the code for a Rational Speech Act (RSA, Frank & Goodman, 2012) model of cross-linguistic pronoun resolution that integrates the relative frequency of alternative constructions derived from corpus studies as utterance costs.

The code is implemented in WebPPL, a probabilistic programming language based on Javascript (Goodman & Stuhlm√ºller, 2015).
